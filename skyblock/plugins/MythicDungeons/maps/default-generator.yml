### MYTHIC DUNGEONS GENERATOR SETTINGS ###
# While there are plenty of comments here, it's recommended to check the wiki for further explanations and examples of some of these config options.

# The layout decides how rooms are generated. Included layout modes are:
# BRANCHING - Generates linearly, with a chance to generate branches. (Configured under 'BranchSettings')
# MINECRAFTY - Generates the dungeon similarly to Minecraft's Strongholds and Nether Fortresses by trying to generate a room at every connector.
Layout: BRANCHING
# General settings applicable to all generated dungeons.
General:
  # A valid Spigot material (must be a block) that will surround all the dungeon rooms. (Set to AIR if you want no surrounding block.)
  # See https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html for a list of material names.
  SurroundingBlock: STONE
  # The minimum number of rooms a MINECRAFTY dungeon must generate with.
  MinRooms: 8
  # The maximum number of rooms a MINECRAFTY dungeon is allowed to have.
  MaxRooms: 16
  # Whether to force the dungeon to have at least the above minimum room count. Set to false if your dungeon is having trouble generating enough rooms.
  StrictRoomCount: true

# Config options used when generating with the BRANCHING layout mode.
BranchSettings:
  # This is the MAIN SECTION of the dungeon; the first "branch" if you will. We call this the "trunk".
  # NOTE: This one is required for the dungeon to generate and cannot be renamed. If it's missing, default values will be used.
  TRUNK:
    # A list of rooms this branch can use. Leave empty to use all rooms. ([] means empty). EXAMPLE:
    # Rooms:
    # - stairs1
    # - bend1
    # - hallway1
    Rooms: []
    # A list of possible rooms this branch could end with. Same format as the above rooms list.
    EndRooms: []
    # How heavily the generator favors generating in a straight line (when possible.) Range from 0 to 1.0
    # NOTE: This is a priority system, not a guarantee!
    Straightness: 0.5
    # The minimum number of rooms the trunk will have. (In this case, this is the amount of rooms in the main section of the dungeon.)
    MinRooms: 12
    # The maximum number of rooms the trunk can have.
    MaxRooms: 24
    # Whether to force the branch to have at least the above minimum room count. Set to false if your dungeon is having trouble generating enough rooms.
    StrictRoomCount: true
  # Here is an example of an alternate branch. The name here can be whatever you want!
  deep_branch:
    Rooms: []
    EndRooms: []
    Straightness: 0.5
    # The minimum number of rooms this type of branch can have.
    MinRooms: 6
    # The maximum number of rooms this type of branch can have.
    MaxRooms: 12
    StrictRoomCount: true
    # A range of how many rooms into the dungeon this branch can generate. Supports operators such as >, >=, <, <=, etc.
    Depth: 8
    # A range of how many times this branch can generate. Supports operators such as >, >=, <, <=, etc.
    Occurrences: 0-1
    # Whether to force this branch to occur at least the above times. Set to false if your dungeon is having trouble generating enough branches.
    StrictBranchCount: true
