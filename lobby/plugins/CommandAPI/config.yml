# Verbose outputs (default: false)
# If "true", outputs command registration and unregistration logs in the console

# If "true", turns off all logging from the CommandAPI, except for errors.
silent-logs: false

# Messages
# Controls messages that the CommandAPI displays to players
messages:
  
  # Missing executor implementation (default: "This command has no implementations for %s")
  # The message to display to senders when a command has no executor. Available
  # parameters are:
  #   %s - the executor class (lowercase)
  #   %S - the executor class (normal case)
  missing-executor-implementation: This command has no implementations for %s

# Create dispatcher JSON (default: false)
# If "true", the CommandAPI creates a command_registration.json file showing the
# mapping of registered commands. This is designed to be used by developers -
# setting this to "false" will improve command registration performance.
create-dispatcher-json: false

# Fallback to latest version (default: true)
# If "true", the CommandAPI will fall back to the latest available NMS
# implementation when the CommandAPI is used and no implementation for the
# current Minecraft version was found.
fallback-to-latest-nms: true

# Skips the initial datapack reload when the server loads (default: true)
# If "true", the CommandAPI will not reload datapacks when the server has finished
# loading. Datapacks will still be reloaded if performed manually when "hook-paper-reload"
# is set to "true" and /minecraft:reload is run.
skip-initial-datapack-reload: true

# Hook into Paper's ServerResourcesReloadedEvent (default: false)
# If "true", the CommandAPI will hook into Paper's ServerResourcesReloadedEvent to detect when
# /minecraft:reload is run. This allows the CommandAPI to automatically call its custom datapack-reloading
# function which allows CommandAPI commands to be used in datapacks.
hook-paper-reload: false

# Turn on the CommandAPI's plugin messaging functionality (default: false)
# If "false", the CommandAPI will not listen to incoming plugin messages
# and attempts to send plugin messages will fail. Enabling networking by
# setting this to "true" is currently only useful for allowing command
# requirements on Velocity.
enable-networking: false

# Turn exceptions while sending and receiving packets into warnings (default: false)
# If "false", the CommandAPI will throw an exception when receiving malformed packets
# or if it tries to send a packet but cannot. If "true", these problems will be logged
# as a warning, which does not include the stacktrace. Additionally, warnings can be hidden
# by setting silent logs to "true".
